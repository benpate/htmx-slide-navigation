# htmx-slide-navigation
Proof of Concept Slider Navigation


This is a *very* rough demo of slider navigation using htmx.  There are a number of things that still need work.

* *Back Button does not work / does not slide.
* *HTML cannot have any whitespace, or else the slider breaks horribly.
* *Currently, every link needs special slider code attached.
* *History API breaks sometimes, though this might not be noticeable with a real app server running behind this.
